## What is this about?

Here you will find some examples of Higher-Order functions in
plain Javascript.

## Why?

Mostly because functional design is awesome. But also
because I'm studying functional Javascript and I think
this repository may be useful for others.

## But what the heck is a "Higher-Order" function

Basicly a Higher-Order function is a function that:
1. Receives a function
2. Returns a function

It may look weird at first sight, but its pretty simple.

Here, let me break it down for you: functions are actions
that return values. A Higher-Order function is a way for
us to easily abstract over these actions, not just over
values. So you have functions that ACT on functions and
also create new functions!

Don't worry, see the examples, study a little more and in
little time you will be coding mapReduce in your sleep!
